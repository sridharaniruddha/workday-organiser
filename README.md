# workday-organiser

## User Story

I'd like to create a work day organiser to efficiently schedule my tasks for the day.  

I want my application to

 - Display the current day at the top of the calender when I open the planner.
 - Present timeblocks for standard business hours (9-17) when the I scroll down.
 - Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.
 - Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock
 - Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.
 - Persist events between refreshes of a page


## Deployment

My site can be accessed on git pages at <https://sridharaniruddha.github.io/workday-organiser/>
